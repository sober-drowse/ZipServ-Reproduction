## Overview

ZipServ is the first **lossless compression framework** co-designed for high-performance LLM inference on GPUs. Through hardware-aware compression algorithms and fused kernel design, ZipServ achieves significant inference acceleration while maintaining bit-exact numerical precision, solving the performance bottleneck of traditional lossless compression methods on GPUs.

> **Note**: ZipServ is optimized for **GDDR memory-based GPUs** (e.g., RTX 4090, L40S, RTX 5090, RTX 6000 Pro) where memory bandwidth is the primary bottleneck. Performance gains may vary on HBM-based datacenter GPUs.

### Key Advantages

- **Lossless Compression**: Up to 30% model size reduction with bit-exact numerical precision
- **Significant Speedup**: Up to 2.21× kernel-level speedup over cuBLAS, 1.22× average end-to-end speedup over vLLM
- **Hardware Co-design**: Optimized for NVIDIA Tensor Core architectures
- **First Practical System**: First demonstration that lossless compression can simultaneously provide storage savings and inference acceleration

## Core Techniques

### 1. Tensor-Core-Aware Triple Bitmap Encoding (TCA-TBE)

Addressing the fundamental mismatch between traditional entropy coding (e.g., Huffman, ANS) and GPU SIMT execution model, ZipServ proposes TCA-TBE encoding:

- **Fixed-Length Format**: Exploits highly skewed distribution of BFloat16 weight exponents using triple bitmap encoding
- **Constant-Time Parallel Decoding**: Achieves branch-free parallel decoding through lightweight bitwise operations, eliminating control-flow divergence
- **Tensor Core Alignment**: Hierarchical tiling organization (8×8, 16×64, 64×64) seamlessly aligns with Tensor Core computation patterns

### 2. ZipGEMM Fused Kernel

Addressing the redundant memory access caused by traditional decoupled pipelines (decompress to global memory, then compute), ZipServ designs a fused decompression-GEMM kernel:

- **"Load-Compressed, Compute-Decompressed"**: Compressed weights are loaded directly into registers and decoded on-the-fly
- **Eliminate Intermediate Buffers**: Decompressed results feed directly into Tensor Cores without going through global memory
- **Maximize Compute Intensity**: Overlaps data movement with computation to fully utilize memory bandwidth

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **CUDA Toolkit**: 11.8 or later
- **GPU**: NVIDIA Ampere architecture or newer (Compute Capability ≥ 8.0)
- **Compiler**: g++ with C++14 support

### Build
